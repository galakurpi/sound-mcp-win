## 🎵 Customizing Sounds

Want to use your own sound effects? It's easy:

1. Find an MP3 sound you like (try [freesound.org](https://freesound.org))
2. Name it `completion.mp3`
3. Place it in the `sounds` folder
4. Restart the server

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will automatically rebuild the project when you make changes.
